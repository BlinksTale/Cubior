Build Instructions: Cubior builds and runs off of a make command, so navigating to the cubior directory and typing "make" should build the project once the correct dependencies are intalled (see bottom of page). Windows will also require MinGW in C and freeglut in a MinGW folder in the C drive.

Controller Options: Gamepads and Keyboard are supported, with up to four Gamepads per device. Includes (but is not limited to) Xbox 360 controllers (Win/Mac), DualShock 3 (Mac), Wavebirds (with USB adapters). Controllers are not yet tested on Linux.

Linux Users will need to install the following packages: (list of dependencies)
    OpenGL: apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
    OpenAL: apt-get install libopenal0a libopenal-dev
    ALUT:   apt-get install libalut0 libalut-dev
    GLee:   apt-get install glee-dev
In addition: SFML 2.1 is needed from the SFML website.
