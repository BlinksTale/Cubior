Build instructions: build & run in command line by typing "make" (Linux/Mac). Windows will require MinGW in C and freeglut in a MinGW folder in the C drive.

Playing instructions: Z to jump, X to freeze, C to rainbow. Arrow keys to move, and you can freeze once per jump from the ground, and jump once from your freeze.
