1) Ideal,

Waterflame:
  Booked for the year, no free work, but will allow me to use any of his songs under Creative Commons license:

"if you see it as a possibility to use allready existing songs, i am ofcource willing to let you use it under the CC, but we could go in to details there if that is a possibility. none of my free released tracks is bound by any company, only by my own label. so if that sounds interesting, let me know. i have a libary of almost 150 songs on youtube now, so you can browse freely as you please." -Waterflame, Newgrounds PM, 9/4ish/12

  Potential songs:
    "Make a Run For It" - sounds like a good title/theme song

2) Of interest,

Joshua Morse:
  No reply yet, lots of waveform and Genesis-esque work though. Cool stuff for sure!

Blake Robinson:
  Too much orchestration, original music doesn't have the catchy nature I'm looking for, but still amazing!
