Cubior level design:
(level editor url? http://www.asciipaint.com )

Current level mechanics:
climbing forwards
platforming sideways/along a wall

Axed level mechanics:
tunnels (most because big-tunnels failed. Are short tunnels doable? Ehh... nut currently)

Maybe axe:
Big levels in general, medium large being the biggest

New level mechanics:
floating platforms/3d platforming
follow-the-path (high up, a maze of space)
