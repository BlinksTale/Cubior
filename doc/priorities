Current priorities as of 12/6/12:

Public Demo Revisions

1. Get camera to not flip out when you jump above it? And are moving up..? Happens
   consistently on middle ledge on first bridge in big grass with lowest camera.
2. Play sound when cubior skids/conflict with direction vs toldDirection
3. When camera locked, slide to side of momentum if greater than half of max momentum
4. Make camera see where you will be going, rather than where you are, for big castle
5. Have camera try checking vertically to resolve visibility issues

also wanted start screen to have all four cubes jumping for goal

0V. Follow both's choose angle flips around on room 2/3, second green room

00. Weirdness when player pauses while touching goal. Pausing should take priority.
     Weirdness also transfers into next level?

0. Looks like wall angle shots are messing things up again: don't let the
    camera rotate while you're jumping!

1. And what is that funkiness on the right front corner of the first pile in room 3?
     that's all in option one, so it must be that viewBoth isn't figuring out which side it's really on.
2. There is an upper bound to how high the camera can rotate before flipping over
   Find what this number is, and do not allow angleX to pass it. STILL NEED TO DO THIS, STILL AN ISSUE.

Old but still worthy priorities

?. Move camera less, keep static more

??. Wouldn't it be cool if in locked mode, it tracked the last dir travelled,
    and would point the camera so you could see further ahead in the dir you were
    about to go in? (ala Mario World)
