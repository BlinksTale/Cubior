Current priorities as of 9/12/12:
1. Fix "wall width 1" visible/invisible detection
2. Fix castle lag/put vertex points in array
3. Adjust angle of movement based on camera angle more precisely

?. Finish cleaning up cameraObj::follow
?. Move camera less, keep static more
?. Camera should swing if possible, not just jump
