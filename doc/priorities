Current priorities as of 9/12/12:
1. Fix castle lag/put vertex points in array
2. Adjust player movement based on camera angle more precisely
3. Smooth camera movements

?. Move camera less, keep static more
?. Make camera line up perpendicular to walls
?. Room 2 camera freakout jumps you to the next level

???. Using int for playerAngle in cameraObj, is this causing some of the player-movement issues?
