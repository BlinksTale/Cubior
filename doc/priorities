Current priorities as of 12/6/12:

Final IGF Revisions!

Build it on Mac and you should be good to go!
(also wanted start screen to have all four cubes jumping for goal)
(unlikely at this point, but camera work is doable!)

Reduce max speed or increase agility at max speed, players feel a loss of control
  with joysticks when moving fast or moving at all..?

0V. Follow both's choose angle flips around on room 2/3, second green room

00. Weirdness when player pauses while touching goal. Pausing should take priority.
     Weirdness also transfers into next level?

0. Looks like wall angle shots are messing things up again: don't let the
    camera rotate while you're jumping!

1. And what is that funkiness on the right front corner of the first pile in room 3?
     that's all in option one, so it must be that viewBoth isn't figuring out which side it's really on.
2. There is an upper bound to how high the camera can rotate before flipping over
   Find what this number is, and do not allow angleX to pass it. STILL NEED TO DO THIS, STILL AN ISSUE.

Old but still worthy priorities

?. Move camera less, keep static more

??. Wouldn't it be cool if in locked mode, it tracked the last dir travelled,
    and would point the camera so you could see further ahead in the dir you were
    about to go in? (ala Mario World)
