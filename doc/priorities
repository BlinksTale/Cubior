Current priorities as of 9/12/12:
00. create an angle of absolution, furthest dimension between camera and target,
    then on all other dimensions (eg, X and Y if abs angle is Z) check if obscuring items have neighbors on either side.
    if neighbors only on one side or none, consider it harmless, but if 
    Nono, scratch that - if any of the three dimensions has neighbors on both sides, it doesn't work.
    Otherwise, it does work.
0. distToCube is not working, giving single digit numbers for double or triple digit differences
   ends up that extra x,y,z vars in cameraObj.h were ruining everything ><
1. Fix CameraObj::follow so it's broken into lookAt and follow
1. Fix castle lag/put vertex points in array
2. Adjust player movement based on camera angle more precisely
3. Smooth camera movements and implement cameraIntendedPos

?. Finish cleaning up cameraObj::follow
?. Move camera less, keep static more
?. Camera should swing if possible, not just jump

?. Make camera line up perpendicular to walls

???. Using int for playerAngle in cameraObj, is this causing some of the player-movement issues?
