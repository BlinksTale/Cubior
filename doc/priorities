Current priorities as of 9/12/12:
000. COOL! A lot of other smoothing stuff is working, backupFreedom is great feeling,
     soooo now I just need to get it to literally not snag on walls while going towards intended pos.
     if I can do that, I think this smooth camera things is about done. TWO FINAL POINTS:
     ONE: still seems to want to always go to the far side of Cubior. Double check that the angles around
          cubior for the "find visible angle" function are all the right angles - it might start on
          the wrong or opposite side.
     TWO: Enable jump mode if not moving while having an intended Pos
     Also... figure out that jumping to the next level automatically thing in room 2, 
     and seriously... clean up these priorities D:
00. create an angle of absolution, furthest dimension between camera and target,
    then on all other dimensions (eg, X and Y if abs angle is Z) check if obscuring items have neighbors on either side.
    if neighbors only on one side or none, consider it harmless, but if 
    Nono, scratch that - if any of the three dimensions has neighbors on both sides, it doesn't work.
    Otherwise, it does work.
0. distToCube is not working, giving single digit numbers for double or triple digit differences
   ends up that extra x,y,z vars in cameraObj.h were ruining everything ><
1. Fix CameraObj::follow so it's broken into lookAt and follow
1. Fix castle lag/put vertex points in array
2. Adjust player movement based on camera angle more precisely
3. Smooth camera movements and implement cameraIntendedPos

?. Finish cleaning up cameraObj::follow
?. Move camera less, keep static more
?. Camera should swing if possible, not just jump

?. Make camera line up perpendicular to walls

???. Using int for playerAngle in cameraObj, is this causing some of the player-movement issues?
