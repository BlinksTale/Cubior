Current priorities as of 12/6/12:

Public Demo Revisions

0. Popup the controls when first starting first level
1. Just after rotating the camera, in mid castle, pressing a direction w/
   keyboard arrows makes you veer towards camera
2. When camera locked, position camera on the side you are moving towards
   (but only if >1/2*maxMomentum is achieved by momentum)
3. Make camera see around corners/non-visible areas, for big castle
   (or, if you go through a "doorway" then swing the camera to the new side)
   (where a "doorway" is defined as columns on either side of you, then not)

Waiting on Rolando for:

1. Play sound when cubior skids/conflict with direction vs toldDirection

also wanted:
0. Figure out why deltasToDegrees is in use while fixedDeltasToDegrees exists
1. Have camera try checking vertically to resolve visibility issues
2. start screen to have all four cubes jumping for goal

0V. Follow both's choose angle flips around on room 2/3, second green room

00. Weirdness when player pauses while touching goal. Pausing should take priority.
     Weirdness also transfers into next level?

0. Looks like wall angle shots are messing things up again: don't let the
    camera rotate while you're jumping!

1. And what is that funkiness on the right front corner of the first pile in room 3?
     that's all in option one, so it must be that viewBoth isn't figuring out which side it's really on.
2. There is an upper bound to how high the camera can rotate before flipping over
   Find what this number is, and do not allow angleX to pass it. STILL NEED TO DO THIS, STILL AN ISSUE.

Old but still worthy priorities

?. Move camera less, keep static more

??. Wouldn't it be cool if in locked mode, it tracked the last dir travelled,
    and would point the camera so you could see further ahead in the dir you were
    about to go in? (ala Mario World)
