Current priorities as of 9/12/12:
0. Current camera fix does not follow player over ledge of castle. Hrmmm.
     Maybe, if the player goes out of view, stop moving the camera. Then, once
     the player stops moving, you can try to fix the camera angle again.
1. Fix castle lag/put vertex points in array
2. Adjust player movement based on camera angle more precisely
3. Smooth camera movements

?. Move camera less, keep static more
?. Make camera line up perpendicular to walls

???. Using int for playerAngle in cameraObj, is this causing some of the player-movement issues?
