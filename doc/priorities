Current priorities as of 9/12/12:
0. Walls not noticed when touching them for wall cam angles
0. Cam gets snagged on castle door. Figure this out.
1. Adjust player movement based on camera angle more precisely

??. multiplayer/splitscreen problem with camera looking not at player when moved.
      may be related to views tied to goal?
?. Move camera less, keep static more
?. Make camera line up perpendicular to walls

???. Using int for playerAngle in cameraObj, is this causing some of the player-movement issues?
