Current priorities as of 10/7/12:

V0. Huge error, there are a set of blocks on the far Z side where if one player
    collides into another on the ground floor, they'll fall through the blocks.
    This is what the daughters of the alumni were reporting at the LMU showing
V. If collision, reset your X/Z that give relation to player you are standing on

0V. Looks like wall angle shots are messing things up again: don't let the
    camera rotate while you're jumping!

1. And what is that funkiness on the right front corner of the first pile in room 3?
     that's all in option one, so it must be that viewBoth isn't figuring out which side it's really on.
2. There is an upper bound to how high the camera can rotate before flipping over
   Find what this number is, and do not allow angleX to pass it. STILL NEED TO DO THIS, STILL AN ISSUE.
3. Make camera look between player and goal at appropriate zoom dist, currently just looks at goal sometimes (castle level?)
4. Maybe have the initial camera drop not snag? Dunno why it does that now. CONFUSES PLAYERS

Old but still worthy priorities

1. Adjust player movement based on camera angle more precisely

??. multiplayer/splitscreen problem with camera looking not at player when moved.
      may be related to views tied to goal?
?. Move camera less, keep static more

??. Wouldn't it be cool if in locked mode, it tracked the last dir travelled,
    and would point the camera so you could see further ahead in the dir you were
    about to go in? (ala Mario World)

???. Using int for playerAngle in cameraObj, is this causing some of the player-movement issues?
