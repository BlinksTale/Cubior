Current priorities as of 9/12/12:
1. Fix CameraObj::follow so it's broken into lookAt and follow
1. Fix castle lag/put vertex points in array
2. Adjust player movement based on camera angle more precisely
3. Smooth camera movements and implement cameraIntendedPos

?. Finish cleaning up cameraObj::follow
?. Move camera less, keep static more
?. Camera should swing if possible, not just jump

?. Make camera line up perpendicular to walls
