For Mac 10.7:
include in the Contents/Frameworks folder the libsfml-xxx.2.dylib files instead of the regular (no 2) versions
ensure also that freetype.framework and sndfile.framework are in there

For Mac 10.8+:
same as 64-bit, only regular dylibs instead of the 2 versions
Not yet sure how to make one version that chooses only the appropriate libraries. Maybe an x64 folder?

So surprisingly, versions 2.1 will work alongside the unnumbered versions on 10.8.
But my MacBook requires the unnumbered versions, and the 10.7 Mac crashes with the unnumbered ones. Odd.

So just make things for Mac 10.7 and up instead of 10.8?

Actually, ultimately: just follow the notes on SFML's page and build for 10.5, not using C++11 features. Then it works on both 10.8 and 10.7. Huzzah!
