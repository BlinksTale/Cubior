lag seems to relate to when I do a lot on one end, and then trying to do something on the other end.
methinks the socket is backed up - that is, it can only handle a receive or a send, not both, so… only do one for each socket. Use two sockets, one outgoing and one incoming. Differentiate by using one to send as host vs one to send as client, and vice versa for reception

No, issue is always from Windows to Mac. Sending Mac to Windows is snappy, regardless of LAN/Online or Host/Client. Windows to Mac is always delayed though. Small windows UDP buffer?

Windows has been hosting each time. Maybe a hosting thing?
Ahhh!
It is alway the host being delayed in its data reaching the client
if the host jumps, it takes a sec for client to get it.
However!
Client immediately gets its data to the host.
Mystery half-solved!
or:
clients are terrible at receiving packages.

Wow! Got a lot done today, but still not done with networking yet.
getLocalAddress still not working on LAN Join command,
need to pull from github (2.1 isn't up to date enough) and compile it for myself

also need to address players not dropping when quitting

libsfml-etc files must also now be copied to framework
snd is also missing? Not sure if a concern

only add player when (after connecting online) you hit OK for controls' infos

Two problems remain:
1) Players remain even after they quit the game. Should disappear instead.
2) If the rearrange happens before the rearranged player starts the game, then everything is broken by the start menu popping up (so make menus the same as the original player in the rearrange transfer)

Other than that… is this thing 2 person online ready?

Cubior's belated todo, starting 1/5/14
yes, it's almost the same as the log, but I like todo better. The log isn't quite the style I'd like.

moving networking today from terminal/console based networking to ingame networking
