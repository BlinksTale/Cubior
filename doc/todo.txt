Wow! Got a lot done today, but still not done with networking yet.
getLocalAddress still not working on LAN Join command,
need to pull from github (2.1 isn't up to date enough) and compile it for myself

also need to address players not dropping when quitting

libsfml-etc files must also now be copied to framework
snd is also missing? Not sure if a concern

only add player when (after connecting online) you hit OK for controls' infos

Two problems remain:
1) Players remain even after they quit the game. Should disappear instead.
2) If the rearrange happens before the rearranged player starts the game, then everything is broken by the start menu popping up (so make menus the same as the original player in the rearrange transfer)

Other than thatâ€¦ is this thing 2 person online ready?

Cubior's belated todo, starting 1/5/14
yes, it's almost the same as the log, but I like todo better. The log isn't quite the style I'd like.

moving networking today from terminal/console based networking to ingame networking
